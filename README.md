# Electric-Vehicle-Forecasting
# Electric Vehicle Forecasting Project
This project is an interactive, multi-page web application designed to eliminate 'range anxiety' for EV users. It uses a Machine Learning model to precisely forecast the vehicle's remaining driving range based on real-time factors like speed, temperature, and terrain. Built using Python and Streamlit.


How to Run the Project Locally
Follow these three simple steps to set up and run the EV Forecasting System on your computer:
1. Download the Project Files
First, download all the project files (code) from this GitHub repository onto your local machine.
2. Set Up the Environment
Ensure you have Python installed.
Install all the necessary software libraries required by the project. These are listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Start the Application
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the main application file (Home.py) using the Streamlit command.
The application will automatically launch and open as a website in your default browser at http://localhost:8501.
⚙️ How to Use the App
Range Predictor: Use the sidebar sliders (Speed, Temperature) on the main page to see instant predictions and Green Skill metrics.
Charging Stations: Enter a location name (e.g., "Delhi, India") to view the nearest charging points and their distance.
Smart Assistant: Navigate to the Smart Assistant page for personalized charging and efficiency advice based on sample data.

Due to GitHub file size limit, the project files (dataset, trained model pkl file, and problem statement) are stored on Google Drive.
